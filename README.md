# penguins_Bot
This bot represents advanced programming in Python, implementing algorithms and data structures to program intelligent agents for a skills programming competition.
There is a game board with a map with a random island order. Each participant (the bot against the enemy) gets a starting island with a number of penguins and must conquer as many islands as possible.
There are different rules and of course we have to evaluate the opponentâ€™s steps to move forward accordingly.
We have developed algorithms that work in response to the agent's actions and future estimation.
